# Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. CKD is a major health concern linked to hypertension, diabetes, and aging. Early detection can help improve treatment and management.

## Introduction  
CKD affects millions worldwide, with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes machine learning to predict CKD status based on 24 clinical attributes.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of 400 patient records, with 158 complete records used to predict CKD status for 242 patients with missing values.  
**Features include:**  
- Age, Blood Pressure, Blood Glucose, Hemoglobin, Red Blood Cell Count, Diabetes, Hypertension, and more.  
- 11 numerical and 14 categorical attributes.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and feature selection.  
2. **Model Training:** Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.  
3. **Model Selection:** Choosing the best model based on accuracy and bias.  
4. **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict CKD status.  

## Models Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- AdaBoost  
- Neural Networks  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ckd-prediction.git  
   cd ckd-prediction  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Run data preprocessing:  
   ```sh
   python preprocess.py  
   ```  
2. Train models:  
   ```sh
   python train.py  
   ```  
3. Make predictions:  
   ```sh
   python predict.py  
   ```  

## Results  
The Extra Trees Classifier and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy in predicting CKD.
